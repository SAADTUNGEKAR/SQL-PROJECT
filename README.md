# SQL-PROJECT_Music_Store_Analysis
SQL project to analyze online music store data

"My motive behind creating a SQL portfolio centered on a music store is to demonstrate my expertise in database management within this specific domain. Through this project, I aim to showcase my SQL skills while highlighting my ability to design and maintain databases tailored to the unique requirements of the music industry. This portfolio will serve as tangible evidence of my proficiency in managing crucial aspects such as album, artist data, and customer records and many more within a music store context. It's not just about showcasing my technical skills but also my passion for merging music and technology to enhance the overall customer experience."
